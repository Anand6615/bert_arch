BERT Architecture (Layer-by-Layer Explanation)
Overview
This repository provides an in-depth implementation of the BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) architecture. Unlike models that rely on pre-trained weights, this project focuses on understanding BERT by explaining each layer and how they work together to achieve contextual understanding in language.

Key Features
Detailed Layer Explanations: Each component, including token embeddings, positional embeddings, multi-head attention, and feed-forward layers, is implemented from scratch with explanations for each.
Educational Focus: The project is designed to help users understand the inner workings of BERT rather than simply applying it as a black box.
Customizable for Experimentation: Users can adjust parameters within each layer to see how changes affect model behavior.

Purpose
This project is ideal for those who want to:

Understand how BERT is structured at a layer-by-layer level.
Learn the principles of transformers and attention mechanisms in detail.
Explore modifications to the BERT model and observe how each layer impacts the overall function
